This document provides some benchmarks for comparing the performance
of hdfqlr to two other HDF file APIs available in R: The 
[`hdf5r`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hdf5r) package 
and the now-deprecated
[`h5`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=h5) package. 
Other packages that provide read (but not write) support for HDF files
were not tested.
