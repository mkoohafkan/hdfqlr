This document gets you up and running with `hdfqlr`, an R interface to
[HDFql](http://www.hdfql.com/). In order to use this package, you will 
need to [download HDFql](http://www.hdfql.com/#download) for your 
system. 

If you are going to be using HDFql regularly, it's a good idea to set
a default HDFql directory for use with `hdfqlr`. You can do this 
by either
 - Setting the R options `hdfqlr.dir` in your .Rprofile file.
 - Setting the system environment variable `HDFQL-DIR`.
If either of these settings exist, the HDFql library will be loaded
on package start.


```r
library(hdfqlr)
```

Otherwise, you can load the HDFql library after package start with
`hql_load()`:


```r
hql_load('path/to/hdfql-x.x.x')
```

If you are on a Linux system, you will need to update
the environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the HDFql 
directories prior to using the package:


```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<hdfql_r_wrapper_directory>:<hdfql_lib_directory>:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

The `hdfqlr` package relies on the R wrapper provided by HDFql. 
Functions exported by the package are prefixed with `hql_` to 
make it easy to differentiate them from the functions provided 
by the wrapper, which are prefixed with `HDFQL_` (for constants)
or `hdfql_` (for functions). The contents of the HDFql wrapper
are imported into the environment `hql$wrapper`. If you need
to directly use the HDFql wrapper functions in an interactive 
session, you can access them using `with` or `attach` the 
environment to the search path. Any existing scripts written for
use with the HDFql wrapper can therefore be run by attaching the
`hql$wrapper` environment prior to running the script, or
by using `with(hql$wrapper, ...)`.


```r
# using with
with(hql$wrapper,
	HDFQL_VERSION
)
```

```
## [1] "2.1.0"
```

```r
# or attach the environment
attach(hql$wrapper)
HDFQL_VERSION
```

```
## [1] "2.1.0"
```

```r
detach(hql$wrapper)
```

The `hdfqlr` package is primarily designed for simple read and write use
cases, i.e. inspecting, reading and writing HDF datasets and attributes. 
In order to access HDF files, they must be opened or "used":


```r
file = tempfile(fileext = ".h5")
hql_create_file(file)
hql_use_file(file)
```
 
Creation of datasets and attributes is accomplished with the
`hql_write_*` family of functions. Groups and sub-groups are created
on the fly when writing datasets or attributes, but can also be 
explicitly created using `hql_create_group()`.
The following example writes a matrix to the file. The
dataset is then read back in and compared to the original R object.
The function `hql_flush` is used to ensure that any buffered data
is written to the HDF file prior to reading the data back into R.


```r
values = matrix(rnorm(1000), nrow = 50)
hql_write_dataset(values, "dataset0")
hql_flush()
all.equal(values, hql_read_dataset("dataset0"),
  check.attributes = FALSE)
```

```
## [1] TRUE
```

Any attributes of the R object (other than `dim`) are also
written to the dataset. To write an attributes (or list of 
attributes) to the root of the HDF file or to a group, use
`hql_write_attribute` (or `hql_write_all_attributes`). 
When writing character datasets, the maximum string length is 
used for all elements of the dataset.


```r
char.values = month.name
attr(char.values, "abb") = month.abb
hql_write_dataset(char.values, "group1/dataset1")
hql_flush()
hql_read_dataset("group1/dataset1", include.attributes = TRUE)
```

```
##  [1] "January  " "February " "March    " "April    " "May      "
##  [6] "June     " "July     " "August   " "September" "October  "
## [11] "November " "December "
## attr(,"abb")
##  [1] "Jan" "Feb" "Mar" "Apr" "May" "Jun" "Jul" "Aug" "Sep" "Oct" "Nov"
## [12] "Dec"
```

The package does not currently support editing existing datasets
or attributes; this is instead accomplished by reading the dataset
or attribute to an R object, modifying it, and writing it back to
the HDF file using the argument `overwrite = TRUE`.

The package also provides options for listing the contents of an
HDF file via the functions `hql_list_groups`, `hql_list_datasets`, and
`hql_list_attributes`. Both `hql_list_groups`and `hql_list_datasets` provide
support for recursively listing sub-groups and sub-datasets.


```r
hql_list_groups()
```

```
## [1] "group1"
```

```r
hql_list_datasets()
```

```
## [1] "dataset0"
```

```r
hql_list_datasets(recursive = TRUE)
```

```
## [1] "dataset0"        "group1/dataset1"
```

```r
hql_list_attributes("group1/dataset1")
```

```
## [1] "abb"
```

Datasets, attributes, and groups can be removed from an HDF file 
via the functions `hql_drop_dataset`, `hql_drop_attribute`, and
`hql_drop_group`.


```r
hql_drop_dataset("dataset0")
```

Once you're finished working with the HDF objects, close the file with
`hql_close_file`:


```r
hql_close_file(file)
```
